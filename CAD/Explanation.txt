CAD Design Explanation

The complete mechanical design of the Samaksh system was developed using Onshape, a cloud-based CAD platform.
The design focuses on creating a compact, lightweight, and wearable structure suitable for smart glasses, while ensuring proper mounting and protection of all electronic components.

The following design files are included:

frame – Represents the main structural frame that supports the overall hardware assembly.

camera_mount – A custom mount designed to securely hold the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W module and pi camera module in the required position for vision capture.

Battery_mount – Contains the housing design that protects internal components and power the device.

The STEP files can be imported into standard CAD software such as Fusion 360, SolidWorks, or similar tools for viewing, modification, or further development.
